# [ML Fall'23] Identifying Loan Completion Status

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the completion status of loans based on a provided dataset. The project is part of the ML Fall'23 course and involves various steps including data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, and model evaluation. Each team member's contribution will be individually assessed during a practical exam.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features related to loans. The target variable is the loan completion status. You can access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZW0Cq2KFiEp0aL1R4KDsl9gYPLXqfuD/view?usp=sharing).

## Project Requirements

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values
   - Perform categorical encoding
   - Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for use

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Preprocess all features
   - Drop features only after preprocessing with valid reasons

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Train at least four classification models

4. **Hyper-Parameter Tuning:**
   - Choose at least two hyperparameters to vary
   - Study at least three different choices for each hyperparameter

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

6. **Test Script:**
   - Write a test script to classify a given test set and print evaluation metrics



## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the loan completion prediction process using various machine learning techniques. Each phase of the project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is crucial for achieving accurate predictions.
